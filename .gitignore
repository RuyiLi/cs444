# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.

#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
